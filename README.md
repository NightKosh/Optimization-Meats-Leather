# Optimization: Meats & Leather

This is a modified and improved version of [Owlchemist's](https://steamcommunity.com/id/owlchemist) "[Optimization: Meats](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1721970101)" mod, and based on its sources.

Unlike original version, this mod additionally replaces all "Alien Races"(from any add on of "alien framework" mod) meat and leather by human meat and human leather.
Also, it replaces all dinosaurs(from "Dinosauria" mod) leather by lizard leather.
